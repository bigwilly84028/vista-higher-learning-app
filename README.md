## Explaination of Work...

I used the Ionic CLI to generate a new blank project,
which gave me the basic starting point. Then I went to work
adding the bits needed to accomplish the requirements.

Most of the intersting parts of this application are located
in src > HomePage.vue.

I chose Ionic as my component framework since it comes with
a grid, icons, buttons and much more. I leveraged the power of
ionic grid to lay out the UI components, ionic buttons and radio
buttons were used and custom styled where possible. The behaviors
are accomplished using standard local state variables and common JS
functions made accessible to the template. Enjoy!
